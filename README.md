Hello, welcome to my GitHub! This space showcases my hobby-related projects. Work completed for university or employment remains private. However, I am happy to discuss those projects, within the bounds of legal allowances, via my LinkedIn.

My primary interests lie in low-level embedded programming and machine learning technologies, but I also frequently create Fullstack Applications with Gin/Flask and React
